# seamless-point-ap-ui

## Setting up the development environment

The UI for **Seamless Point WiFI AP UI** is built using **React**, bootstrapped by **create-react-app**. In order to develop for the UI you need to do the following:

1. Run `npm install` in the UI folder.
2. Run `npm start` to start the development server. This will serve the UI on `localhost:3000` by default.
3. Any changes to the code will automatically reflect in the UI without having to manually refresh.

The production bundle is generated by running `npm build`, which will bundle and minify the react code. This will create a `build` folder where all the static resources will be located. You can then serve the `index.html` file and the contents of the `build` folder however you wish.
